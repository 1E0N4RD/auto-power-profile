# Auto Power Profile

## Scope
Small tool to automatically change the power profile based on events generated by plugging or unplugging power supplies.
This project aims to explore some low level linux APIs in C. There are simpler ways to do this.

## Features

Plug in power supply -> 'performance'
Unplug power supply -> Battery low ? 'power-saver' : 'balanced'
Battery low -> power supply plugged in ? nothing : 'power-saver'
Battery not low -> power supply plugged in ? nothing : 'balanced'
